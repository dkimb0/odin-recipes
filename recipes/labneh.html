        <h3>This strained and lightly salted Middle Eastern yogurt is often served at breakfast or as a snack drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled with za’atar, and scooped up with pita bread.</h3>
        <p>Labaneh was something my Palestinian mom has always eaten regularly with fervor, often serving it as a makeshift dinner alongside other simple dishes like sauteed tomatoes, hummus, and scrambled eggs when we didn’t really feel like cooking. But while I grew up eating labaneh, it took time for my own appreciation to grow because as a kid, I hated it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 gallon milk</li>
            <li>2tbsp yogurt</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
