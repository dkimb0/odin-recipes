            <p>When John Chandler submitted this Carnitas recipe to MC FRIED more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Carnitas racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.</p>
